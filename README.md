# GamovideoDownloader
Simple script to download Gamovideo videos

# Easy
This script works in Chrome and Firefox (I haven't tried it in other browsers yet)

- 1º Create a Bookmark 
- 2º Edit the Bookmark and set all the JS on the COMPRESSED VERSIONS as the URL of the Bookmark
- 3º Open a Gamovideo 
- 4º press Control+U or left click on the web (no the video) and click "see code" and search for "vplayer" and you should see a image with a IP, you should the IP like "http://XX.XXX.XXX.XXX:XXXX/"
- 5º Click the Bookmark and add the IP and then the download will start 
- **Note for 4º step** (In firefox will open a video, then you can press right click and select "Download the video")

# **Note**
This script is obviously very ingrained to the current HTML of the web page, as soon as you change the script it will stop working as it should.

# **Note V2 24/01/2020
The V1 version still works in some videos, but the v2 is a improved for some specific URLS.

# **Note V3 17/01/2020
Looks like V1 and V2 don't works anymore, they change the code a little so i add the V3 with a alert where you need to put the IP of the download, you can see how know the URL on the 4º step
