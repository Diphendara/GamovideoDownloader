# GamovideoDownloader
Simple script to download Gamovideo videos

# Easy
This script works in Chrome and Firefox (I haven't tried it in other browsers yet)

- 1º Create a Bookmark 
- 2º Edit the Bookmark and set all the JS as the URL of the Bookmark
- 3º Open a Gamovideo 
- 4º Click the Bookmark, and then the download will start **Note for 4º step** (In firefox will open a video, then you can press right click and select "Download the video")

# **Note**
This script is obviously very ingrained to the current HTML of the web page, as soon as you change the script it will stop working as it should.
